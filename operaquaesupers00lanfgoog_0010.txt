of the work. May it not be reasonable to suppose that the
whole work is no more than a collection of notes taken from
Lanfranc’s lecturest foras having been an eminent instruc-

et sanguine Domini nostri, which Lanfranc composed to
refute the heresy of BerengariuS, of which afuller account
may be seen in the first volume of this edition. It is found
in the folio volume of D'Achery, and elsewhere among the
works of Lanfrane: it was also printed with the Patres or-
thodoxographi in 1555 and with Alger, Guimund etc. by
Ultimerius, 8⁰ Lovan. 1561.

In a manuscript of this work preserved in the British Mu· “
