PREFACE. ι vn

rium is nothing but the Commentary on the Epistlesof

⁶ St. Paul under another name. n [Wright's Biographia Bri-
J tannica, vol. IL]

To this may be added that in the library of Trinity Col-

’ lege Dublin are three manuscripts of this book, entered

' under the name of Lanfranc : though it is fair to state that '

· by far the greater number of manuscripts ascribe the work

to Anselm. or at least not to Lanfranc.

lt is bere given as his work, because its style and matter·
shew it decidedly not to belong to the sedate Anselm, and
because even if not written by Lanfranc it certainly is the
work of some one who was his contemporary, and there is
no other writer of that egeto whom it can with so much-
propriety be attributed. Though it abouods with many ins-

. tances of most absurd andpuerile explanations‚ itneverthe-

less contains many passages which will not only amose the

· reader, but give himafair sample of the Christian metaphy-

sicsof that early period. The work is found in all the editions
of Anselm.

The Sermo sive Sententiae which follow is not found in
D‘Achery's folio edition of the works of Lanfranc: but was ·
published by him at a later period in his Spicilegium from a
manuscript preserved in the Library of Brasenose Collega,
Oxford.

The brief Annotatiurzculoe ad collationes Parrum and

the Libellus (le celanda confhrrione are given from the

folio edition of D'Achery.
The V artae Lectiones at the end of the volume will inform

the readerwhat manuscripts andprevious editions have been
consulted in prepanng the text of the works here enu-
merated
