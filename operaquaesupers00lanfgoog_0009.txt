PREFACE

ΤΟ

THE SECOND VOLUME.

ln the preceding volume are comprised those works ol
Lanfranc which are of an Epistolary or Historical character,
together with an Appendix consisting oi various documents
closely connected with his history.

We now introduce to the reader's notice the lew treati-

· ses on Theological, Metaphysical and Moral subjects which
1 are known or generally believed to have proceeded from his

pen, and the labors of foreign scholars have enabled us to
give amore complete collection of these than has hitherto

a eared.
Pl'hhe first entitled Commentario ιίι omnes B. Pauli epis-

' tolon is more properly speaking a collection of notes than

a regular commentary. lt has been suggested by the writ-
ers of the Histoire litte'raire de Franco ,· that this work is
not agenuine productiori of Lanfranc‚ because it does not
contain twopassages whichSigebert quotes froin Lonsranr’r
Commentory on the Hebraeos. But it appears from an in-
spection of the manuscripts that there are some of much
greater length than others, and all abound with such verbal
differences as to render the fact abovenamed of very httle
importance in determining the question ol the authorship
